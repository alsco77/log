1-Mar-2018,Easy Way to quit smoking,Allen Carr,ac-smoke,Friend (Dave),Habits,5,"This book not only allows you to effortlessly quit smoking (as in, you just dont want to smoke any more) but it is an enjoyable read and unpacks the systematic pro-cigarette brainwashing that we have been subjected to, replacing it with a sort of supercharged method of CBT. Aside from not craving a cigarette since reading, this book displayed to me just how easily manipulated the mind is. This led me to critically think about what we need/enjoy in life and what we just think we need, in an attempt to dispell propaganda and live more naturally. I used the same techniques to quit alcohol and it has inspired me to take on CBT for my insomnia.",
1-Dec-2018,Sapiens,Yuval Noah Harari,yh-sapiens,-,History,5,"A really great read. Sapiens provides a fresh perspective (at least to me) on the history of civilisation and fills in a lotttttt of gaps of my knowledge as to how we got here. So interesting to hear about the origins of humanity through the eyes of a well read anthropologist who can simply explain complex topics and give you insight into the lives of historic societies and cultures. This book challenged and changed my perception of the world in many ways. To name a few - the birth of capitalism & the world changing effect it had to those who utilised it (Spanish conquering Aztecs, British/Dutch conquering). The negative, sweeping effect that monotheistic religions and orthodox humanism have had for the rest of life on Earth. Viewing life as competing organisms with the goal to replicate and survive, rather than individual entities - plants & thought patterns included.",
1-Mar-2019,Homo Deus,Yuval Noah Harari,yh-deus,-,History,4.5,"An interesting albeit long winded read and continues from the theme of Sapiens. Does an excellent job of explaining the imaginary human constructs that have developed over time, gods, states, corporations, laws.. which are so engrained in modern society that we take them to be natural. This book dispells humanism and human rights as imaginary constructs and forced me to view the mass harvesting of animals (and the effect this could have on their emotions) in a different light, a view made more eerie by the proposal that our minds act in a deterministic manner with an injection of randomness. The discussion of the future, the case for Dataism and the quest for immortality are all captivating topics",
1-Jul-2018,Thinking Fast and Slow,Daniel Kahneman,dk-thinking,-,Psychology,4.5,"Even though this was a fascinating and informative read, I was so glad to finish - it is a long and sometimes tedious one.  There are loads of great things to take away - the roles and pitfalls of system 1 and system 2 (instinct vs critical thinking), the power of loss aversion, fight or flight responses (not just physically), experience vs rememvering self and a myriad of others. There are many cognitive biases detailed - the knowledge of which will not stop you being subject to them, but being aware of it all definitely helps and since reading it has been exciting to identify many of the patterns and biases first hand.",
1-Nov-2017,Elon Musk - Quest for a Fantastic Future,-,em-quest,-,Biography,4.5,"An interesting and inspiring life from beginning to present, from his troubled childhood during which he devoured books, through forming successful startups and onwards to marching society forward through a multitude of visionary, innovative and incredibly impressive companies.",
23-May-2019,How Not to Die,Gene Stone and Michael Greger,hntd-gene,Friend (Greg),Health,4.5,"Inspired me to take up a whole foods plant based diet and to disregard traditional concepts of a balanced diet. Showed me using an evidence based approach how much of an effect a whole foods, plant based diet can have on longevity and for avoiding disease. ",
1-Jun-2018,Surely you're joking Mr Feynman!,Richard Feynman,rf-joking,-,Biography,4,"Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize winning Physicist tells the story of his life - from an inquisitive childhood through an early career, wartime building the H-bomb and onwards. He is always getting up to mischief and making the most of every situation he encounters, not afraid to be a contrarian and acts with conviction, integrity and humour. My Feynman recognises that education systems that teach pure theory produce rigid and irrelevant results for a practical world. He inspires to learn through interest and expirement. The true measure of knowledge is your ability to explain it in simple terms to another. He inspires to jump head first into your surrounding culture, and his success in these activities (playing in a band in portugal, becoming an acclaimed painter) reminds you that with a bit of practice, its easy to make a noticible impact.",
1-Nov-2018,A Random Walk Down Wall Street,Burton G. Malkiel,bm-walk,Daniel Kahneman,Finance,4,"I am glad to have read this book in my early 20s - it contains solid financial advice for safely and efficiently navigating your personal finances. Whilst he speaks with ultimate conviction on theories like the Efficient Market Hypothesis, he is met with strong conviction, and so generally the advice should be taken with a pinch of salt. Regardless, amongst the many takeaways - the advice (and evidence) for investing early, aiming for low fee index funds distributed correctly, accounting for probable risk/movements and re-distributing funds as a method to automatically buy low/sell high has been well recieved.",

1-Mar-2019,Zero to 1 ,Peter Theil,pt-zero,-,Business,3,"Great insight into what it takes to 'go from zero to 1' i.e. making a breakthrough technology (Uber, Facebook, Google etc). Argues that competition is bad for business and that its not enough to pretend to differentiate (see Airline profits) you need to really provide a service magnitudes above your competitors in order to achieve a monopoly (Google vs Bing). Many more great take aways from Thiel and the Paypal mafia operations. ",
