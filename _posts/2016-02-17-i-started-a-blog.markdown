So in the past few days I have finally got around to setting up a place in which to more permanently store my thoughts, I give you [alexscott.xyz](http://alexscott.xyz)! It's a shame that the owner of .com is looking for £8000 but hey, there you go. Anywho, here I plan on leaving posts on a wide array of subjects I find interesting, and on challenges overcome in development. 

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the Inidigo Theme (with a few minor tweaks) by [Sérgio Kopplin](https://github.com/sergiokopplin). I am glad to have stumbled upon this theme as it has everything I was initially intending to create, however I will get round to making my own in the future as I find Jekyll very impressive. It makes use of nested layouts with [YAML](http://yaml.org/) headers, modular [liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) templating and [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to provide a really clean site structure which (once set up) is quick and easy to add pages and posts to.
