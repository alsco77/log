## Consciousness

Freud's [theory](http://www.simplypsychology.org/unconscious-mind.html) of the conscious mind and all mental processes within it being just the tip of the iceberg with regards to what is going on inside our minds has resonated within me over the past few years. It is a fascinating albeit somewhat unnerving prospect that our conscious actions and thoughts are dictated by our un-conscious, or at least influenced heavily by it. So how do we know which of our thoughts are organic and which are a product of our unnavigated mind? (This might be a discussion for another day)

When you sleep, your conscious mind turns itself off and sleeps while your subconscious mind remains awake creating dreamworlds in which you experience a series of thoughts, images, and sensations. The theme or setting of these dreams doesn't just come out of nowhere, it is influenced by your life, what is stressing you out, what you are afraid of, what you fantasize about, and can be presented to you symbolically or realistically. Sometimes dreams can be a wonderful experience in which you act out a role you have always wanted, and sometimes you can wake up in a cold sweat from a scary experience.

What if I told you it was possible to retain consciousness whilst in these dreams, a place where one was not bound by the laws of physics or society, where it was possible to do **anything** or fly **anywhere** one desired, where you could delve into the meanings of your symbolic dreams and consciouslly interact with your subconscious, feeling real emotions and experiencing (_what feel like_) real situations, and remember it all when you wake up!


## Enter lucid dreaming

Well it is, Lucid Dreaming provides a platform from which the individual can converse with and explore their unconscious mind...

> Lucid Dreaming - conscious awareness during the dream state - is an exhilarating experience. Because the world you are experiencing is one of your own creation, you can do the impossible and consciously influence the outcome of your dreams.
-Stephen LaBerge

After recently coming across the [sub-reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/luciddreaming) for lucid dreaming, I was directed towards Stephen LaBerge's [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Exploring-World-Dreams-Stephen-LaBerge/dp/034537410X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1454502886&sr=1-1) 'Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming'. One which I would now highly recommend. LaBerge has created a science out of lucidity, and explains in great detail the techniques involved in inducing lucid dreams and the benefits in interacting with the dream itself.

I have used his techniques to induce Lucid Dreams of my own, in which I have flown across countries, ski'd down incredible mountains, teleported, met people I look up to, etc.. They have been exceptionally enjoyable experiences.

### How do you do it?

In short, a lucid dream is initialised by realising while you are dreaming, that you are in fact in a dreamworld. In theory it is simple, but in practice.. not so much. When we dream, our minds attempt to rationalise or justify everything it comes across, no matter how bizarre. These bizarre occurances, like interacting with somebody who is deceased, are things we can use to realise we are dreaming. Anyway, below I will outline the steps I used to attain my first lucid dream.

#### Step 1 - Improving your dream recall

Being able to remember your dreams once you've had them is a pre-requisite to lucid dreaming (naturally). 

How - **Keep a dream diary**, every time you wake up in the morning (or through the night) attempt to recall the dream from which you woke. Write down what you remember, and try to think as far back as possible. Remember things that happen often, these are **dream signs**<br />
Goal - Be able to recall at least 1 dream a night, with the ability to think back long enough for a decent story to take place. 

#### Step 2 - Reality checking

Essentially you are checking that you aren't dreaming, you ask yourself "Am I dreaming or awake?", look around for oddities or inconsistencies that might indicate you are dreaming, think back to the events of the last several minutes, if you are having trouble then you may be dreaming. To solve this question you can also find some writing, read it, look away, and attempt to read it again, if the words haven't mutated in some way, you are still awake!

Do this as often as you can throughout the day, at least 10 times a day. It is easier to keep track if you decide to do the test every time you speak to someone or open a door (for example).

#### Step 3 - Induce the dream

Before you go to bed, tell youself "Tonight I will realise I am dreaming". <br />
_**Every** time_ you wake up during the night: <br />
	1. Remember the dream from which you awoke <br />
	2. Tell yourself you will realise you are dreaming when you fall back asleep<br />
	3. Picture yourself back in the dream<br />
	4. Go about until you find a **dream sign**<br />
	5. Conduct a reality check, and then imagine yourself flying, or whatever you intend to do when you are dreaming.<br />
	6. Repeat 1-5<br />
	
Your transition from waking life to the dream state will be smooth, you won't even notice it. And you will be there, in the dream, fully conscious, with the resources and ability to explore and do anything you want. 

### Why bother?

Not only is lucid dreaming fun but its also incredly rewarding, it can be used for personal advancement, increasing self confidence, rehearsing situations for life, creatively solving problems and personally healing! It is a funny thought that one can access and utilise the vast knowledge stored in their unconscious mind (which they may have obtained without conscious knowledge) to solve complex problems that they may struggle to do only relying on their conscious mind. 

Anyway, one story from Stephen Laberge's book really caught my attention, in which a dreamer uses their time asleep to become a master of their profession!

> I discovered in high school that I was a lucid dreamer when I learned that I could study complicated mathematical and geometry problems before going to bed and discovered that I was able to solve the problems when I awakened.<br />
This phenomenon followed me through college and medical school. When I was in medical school, I began to apply my sleep-solving abilities to medical problems, quickly running through the questions of the day and usually finding useful solutions or useful additional questions in the process (even today I will occasionally wake up at 3:00 in the morning and call the hospital to order a special laboratory test of a problem patient, the possible solution of which had occurred to me in a lucid dream).<br />
At this point, the greatest use to which I have been able to put this facility is in the practice of surger. Each night before retiring I review my list of surgical cases and I actually practice these cases in my sleep. I have gained a reputation for being a rapid and skilled surgeon with almost no major complications. This surgical "practice" has allowed me from the very beginning to constantly review the anatomy and to refine and polish technique by eliminating unncessary motions. I am presently able to perform most makor complex procedures in 35 to 40 percent of the time taken by most of my peers. (R.v., Aikem, So Cal)

### Summary

Lucid Dreaming is awesome! Try it!
