## What is this all about?
This is __NOT__ some sort of ponzi scheme or a guide how to get rich quick.. but an explanation of a set of simple rules that you can apply to your financial management in order to accumulate wealth and prepare for the future. <br/>
These are general life lessons achievable by all and should provide the basis to stability in your mind and bank account. <br/>
I am writing this because I feel that this is basic information that a large proportion of people could benefit from hearing.. if you are in the system you may as well make the best of it!

#### Pre-requisites
 - A job that pays you more than you need to survive
 - Moderate self control
 - Common sense

## Golden rules
1. Set aside money each month
2. Invest wisely
3. Start as soon as possible

### 1) Setting aside money each month
Nearly everyone will spend every last penny in their current account in anticipation for their next paycheque, it's just human nature! The easiest way to save money is to just __take it out of your bank account as soon as you get paid and tuck it away in savings__.. whether that be daily, weekly or monthly!<br />
You might say WOW, this doesn't sound like fun... i'll just wait till i'm older. Just give it a try, personally I genually find satisfaction from making the transfer into the savings account.<br/>
Figure out how much money you generally spend for food, rent and living expenses, factor in your recreational activities, add a little cushion on the top and then subtract this from your salary... and hey presto! This is how much you should be putting into your savings each time you get paid.<br/>
I am not a fan of meticulously planning out expenses for the month or living off pot noodles or rice or something.. this isn't sustainable and will burn you out. You need to keep a realistic aim for your recurring savings.

#### Remember the tighter times
As you get a steady income it is very easy to gradually grow accustomed to a more lavish lifestyle, whether this means buying extra clothes or getting that bottle of grey goose when you are out partying. But you must remember your roots.. you don't actually need this extra stuff and you managed before without it, so maybe you can cut this stuff out and contribute further to your savings. <br/>
We are exposed to so many __adverts__ these days and it has become so much a part of our society that we don't even realise that we are being sold to any more.. even the lyrics of popular music are telling us to go out and spend our money frivelously with rappers gloating about all their money and lavish lifestyle.. we are being exposed to all these brands and signals.. you need to try and understand that you do not need all this shit! Your consumerism and materialism can be controlled!


### 2) Invest wisely
It is very easy to get suckered into get rich quick schemes of various sorts.. so it is important to be able to spot opportunities that are too good to be true.<br/> 
At the moment crypto currencies can provide huge returns with many people claiming to be able to get you rich, and while I do endorse crypto and particularly the underlying technology, I do not endorse the scammers and pseudo 'traders' that come with it. <br/>
Whilst established markets like stocks & shares do not offer jaw dropping returns, they (generally) provide a steady return on investment that far exceeds the rate of savings accounts (disregarding events like the housing market crash - see timing investments).
The following rules apply to stocks & shares and those markets who share common principles.


#### Choosing the right stock
There are sh*tloads of choices out there... how are you supposed to know which one to pick? Well, unless you are knowledgable about particular industries and can spot a long term winner, an advisable long term bet is to go for [index funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp), which give returns based on the performance of the overall market. I first observed this theory in Daniel Kahnemans [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow) 'Thinking fast and slow' in which he invalidates the hedge fund managers position by showing them that their funds performed no better than an absolute blind pick over a long period of time.<br/>
This concept was put in to practice by Warren Buffet who WON a [$1 million bet](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/warren-buffett-wins-million-dollar-bet-against-hedge-funds-2018-1?r=US&IR=T) that an index fund would out perform a basket of hedge funds over a 10 year period. 

#### Dollar cost averaging
In a nutshell, this technique is when you spread your investment out over a period of time in order to average out the purchase price of the asset. The goal here is to mitigate risk and ensure you get a fair buy in price however you may miss out on a good opportunity. Regardless, this is a good strategy for a new investor. Check out [some more reading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp).

#### Timing your investments
If you have time to check out [this video on how the economic machine works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0), it will explain the 5 and 10 year debt cycles which seemingly naturally occur in our economy. Historically through the 20th century we have seen a series of booms and busts, which are now more commonly accentuated by common psychological traits of investing (see F.O.M.O. [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz_9VsW869Y)).<br/>
In recent years we have seen the dot com bubble burst (2001) and the housing market crash (2008), note that it has been 10 years since the last crash... and since the housing market burst, the value of NASDAQ has risen roughly 600%... this to me, based on history, means it may not be the most perfect time to invest.<br/>
Generally, if you observe these big events, and don't let emotions make your decisions for you, then you have a big platform from which to make good investments.


#### Keep a diverse portfolio
Owning assets of different types (gold, bonds, stocks, crypto) will help you mitigate risk and is always advisable. It is common sense.<br/>
In addition, to properly capitalise on the point above (timing your investments) you need to ensure you keep sufficient <b>cash</b> ready. Should the markets crash you will wish you had liquid cash ready to invest.<br/>
Remember, <b>fiat is part of a balanced portfolio</b>.


### 3) Start as soon as possible
Don't wait around to begin saving up. The earlier you invest, the more the investment will be worth by the time you are at 60. For example, investing $1000 and getting 10% interest a year ($100) means that by year 2 that $1000 investment will be worth $1100, meaning that by year 3 you get interest on that $100 (an extra $10), up to $1210... and so on. This is compounding interest in a nutshell. 

#### The power of compounding interest
Taking view of the following diagrams, each given a modest interest rate of 8% a year, you can see the potential gains made:

- Investing $500 a month from the age of 22 to 60 (38 years) = $1,487,000
- Investing $500 a month starting at age <b>32</b> to 60 (28 years) = $628,000
- Making the same gains in 28 years as in step one - takes <b>$1183</b> (roughly 2.2x as much)

<br/>

Essentially this shows us that you get rewarded heavily (in the long term) for investing early. You are saving yourself a large amount of hassle later on in life by getting the ball rolling early.


## Other tips
 - Get a part time job that you enjoy. Not only could this be fun, but on top of your base salary this is pure savings
 - Initially, build up a security fund of 3 months living expenses, so should you lose your job or have difficulties, you won't need to liquidate any assets
 - Sleep on big purchases, you may find out that you don't really want/need the item the next day

## Summary
Making small changes to your lifestyle now will have a snowball effect throughout your life. Get going and set yourself up for a financially secure life.
